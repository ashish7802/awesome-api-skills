| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fake npm badge & install instructions                                         | Removed; README uses `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm dev`                                        |
| Wrong GitHub org (`awesome-api-skills/core`)                                  | Badges and links point to `ashish7802/awesome-api-skills`                                            |
| Fake domains (`*.awesome-api-skills.dev`, `official.registry`, `awesome.api`) | Removed or replaced with local paths / GitHub tree URLs                                              |
| Hardcoded benchmark table                                                     | Removed from README; `scripts/dev/benchmark.js` no longer prints fake timings                        |
| AI release artifacts                                                          | Deleted `RC2_REPORT.md`, `repository-report.json`, `performance-report.json`, `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` |
| Mock docs site content                                                        | Regenerated from real `skills/` directory; removed 4 placeholder skill pages                         |
| Root script clutter                                                           | Moved into `scripts/generators/`, `scripts/release/`, `scripts/dev/`, `scripts/migrations/`          |
| Coverage report location                                                      | Moved to `docs/reports/coverage-report.json`                                                         |
| `package.json` superlative description                                        | Replaced with factual description                                                                    |
| Default registry URL in core config                                           | Changed to `./registry`                                                                              |
| Docs generator fake publishers                                                | Removed "official" badges and unpublished CLI install steps                                          |
| `pnpm build` / `typecheck` filters                                            | Fixed Windows-compatible `@awesome-api-skills/*` filter                                              |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml`                                                         | Fixed invalid `allowBuilds` entry blocking installs                                                  |

| :------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| 100 skills           | 100 directories under `skills/`   |
| MIT license          | `LICENSE` file                    |

## Links verified

| URL                                                  | Result                                                                  |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://registry.npmjs.org/@awesome-api-skills/cli` | 404 (confirmed unpublished — not linked anymore)                        |
| `https://registry.awesome-api-skills.dev`            | 404 (removed from docs)                                                 |
| `https://www.contributor-covenant.org/`              | 200                                                                     |
| `.design/banner.svg`, `.design/media/demo.svg`       | Present in repository                                                   |
| Skill vendor doc links in `skills/*/SKILL.md`        | Third-party documentation (not re-verified exhaustively in this sprint) |

GitHub repository URLs return 404 to anonymous HEAD requests in this environment (likely private or branch naming); the clone remote and local `LICENSE` file are the source of truth for badges.

| `node apps/docs/scripts/generate.js`    | Pass (100 skills indexed)                  |

README quick start commands (`pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm dev`) match `package.json` scripts.

## Assets verified

| Asset                    | Status                                               |

## Remaining known limitations

1. **CLI not on npm** — build from source; documented in README and docs home page.
2. **CI workflow branch** — workflows trigger on `main`; default git branch may be `master`. Badge may show "unknown" until branches align.
3. **`snapshots/sitemap.xml`** — may still contain legacy URLs until regenerated through the generator pipeline.
4. **Docs stubs** — `apps/docs/src/docs/*.md` are brief pointers to repository paths, not full published documentation.
5. **Skill content** — individual skills quote vendor taglines (e.g. PostgreSQL marketing copy); these are third-party descriptions, not project claims.
6. **`SPECIFICATION.md`** — retains normative "official registry" language as spec terminology; not presented as a live service claim in README.
